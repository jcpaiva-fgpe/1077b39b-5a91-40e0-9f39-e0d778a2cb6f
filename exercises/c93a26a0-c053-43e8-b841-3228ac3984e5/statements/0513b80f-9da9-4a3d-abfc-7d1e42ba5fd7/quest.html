<h4> Limits for shipping </h4> <br>
<p> Write a program that will calculate the total weight of packages to be shipped. An online retailer sells two products wholesale: rollers for painting and brushes.<p>
<p> Each roller weighs 75 grams. Each brush weighs 112 grams. One parcel can bear a maximum of 20 kg, so the total weight of one parcel cannot exceed 20 kg. If more than 20 kg of rollers / brushes, the number of packages must be adapted to the order.
Write a program that reads with repetitions the number of rollers and the number of brushes of an order from the user. Then your program should calculate and display the total weight of the order, the number of packages, package type (below 10 kg - small package, over 10 kg large package. Please, refer to the el. from the parcels_id list). Finally, the program should display the weight of the lightest package. </p> 
<br>
<p>parcels_id = ['small package', 'large package'] </p> <br>
<p> An example of an execution flow: </p>
<ol>
<p> Computer: <code> Enter the number of rollers: </code> </p> 
<p> User: <code> 100 </code> </p> 
<p> Computer: <code> Enter the number of brushes: </code> </p> 
<p> User: <code> 150 </code> </p>
<p> Computer: <code>The total weight of the packages is: 24300 g ~ 24.3 kg </code> </p>
<p> Computer: <code> Number of packages: 2, the lightest: a small package, weight: 4.3 kg </code> </p>
<p>Computer: <code> Next order? </code> </p> 
<p> User: <code>No.</code> </p>
<p>	Computer terminates the program. </p>
</ol>

<p> Attention: Only in case if the user enters 'yes' (any case variation) as an input, the program will proceed.</p>
<p>Apply the numeric rounding to 1-decimal place if the unit is set to kg. </p>
