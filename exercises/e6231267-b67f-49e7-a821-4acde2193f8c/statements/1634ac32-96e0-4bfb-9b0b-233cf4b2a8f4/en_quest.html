<h4> PESEL number checking </h4>
<br>
<p> Write a program that reads the user's last name and the PESEL number after a space, and prints out information that can be extracted from the PESEL number (for example, age, gender and you can check if the PESEL number is correct according to a specific formula). </p>
<p> You can extract following data from the PESEL number: </p>
<ol>
    <p> numbers from 1 to 6 - date of birth with indication of the century of birth </p>
    <p> numbers from 7 to 9 - series number </p>
    <p> digit 10 - gender </p>
    <p> digit 11 - check digit </p>
</ol>
<p> Verify PESEL by the given formula: </p> <ol>
<p> The last digit of the PESEL number is the so-called a check digit, it allows you to verify the PESEL number, whether it has been entered correctly. </p>
<p> Use the math formula: <br> 1 * a + 3 * b + 7 * c + 9 * d + 1 * e + 3 * f + 7 * g + 9 * h + 1 * i + 3 * j , where the letters from a to j stand for the next digits of the PESEL number. The last digit of the PESEL number will be the result of this formula. From the obtained result, take the last digit and subtract from the number 10. The obtained result should match the last digit of the PESEL number. </p> </ol>
<p> If the entered PESEL number has been successfully verified, display the message including gender and age, according to pattern: </p>
<br> <p> First example of an execution flow: </p>
<ol>
    <p> User: <code> Tomczak 96022277319 </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> Mr. Tomczak(25), February 22, 1996, PESEL: 96022277319. </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> Enter your name and PESEL number: <code> </p>
    <p> User: <code>end</code> </p>
    <p> Computer terminates the program. </p>
</ol>
<p> Second example of an execution flow: </p>
<ol>
    <p> User: <code> Nowak 08290725582 </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> Mrs. Nowak(12), 07/09/2008. PESEL: 08290725582. </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> Enter your name and PESEL number: <code> </p>
    <p> User: <code> Incorrect 96022277311 </code> </p>
    <p> Computer terminates the program. </p>
</ol>
<p> Note 1: Both the lack of a PESEL number and an incorrectly entered PESEL number interrupts the operation of the program. </p>
<p> Note 2: The program is to function properly for people born from 1900, for example the PESEL number for this case: 00010135217, and for those born after 2000 (until 2099). For example,the PESEL number for person born after 2000, has a slightly different formula: 11210117543. Give thought the PESEL number for years after 2000, the the month value is incremented by 20. </p>
