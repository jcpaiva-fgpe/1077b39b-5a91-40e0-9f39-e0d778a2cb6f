<h4> Word with the highest number A </h4>
</br>
<p> Write a program that will read any string from the user and as an output the word with the highest number of A-letters will be shown.</p> <br> 
<p> An example of an execution flow: </p>
<ol> <p>Computer: <code> String: </code> </p>
    <p> User: <code> Aha! This barbacane is voguish. </code> </p> 
    <p> Computer: <code> barbacane </code> </p> </ol>
<p> Note 1: Capital letters have the same importance as lower case, but be careful while displaying the word, the input should reflect the output. </p>
<p> Note 2: Don't worry if two words have the same letters (either display one of them or both). </p> 
<br>
