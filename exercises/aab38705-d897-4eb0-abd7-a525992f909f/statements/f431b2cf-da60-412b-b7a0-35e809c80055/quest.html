<h4> Repetitions </h4>
<p> Write a program that checks the text for repeated words (ie occurring more than once, not necessarily next to each other). Ignore case sensitivity. 
<p> There are three different examples of execution flows below: </p> 
<ol>
<p> User: I eat what I eat <br> Computer: <code> True </code>  (&#39; eat &#39;) </p>
<p> User: A cow is a dog <br> Computer: <code> False </code> </p>
<p> User: Aha, aha, aha, blah, blah, blah. <br> Computer: <code> True </code> (&#39; aha &#39; and &#39; bla &#39;) </p> 
</ol>
<p> Please do not display those duplicate words in parentheses, the program has to display: <code> True </code> or <code> False </code> only. </p>
<br>
<p> If you would like to test how your code works, feel free to use the example above. </p>
<p> To complete the task, write your code and click the Submit button. </p> <br>
<p> Good luck! </p>
