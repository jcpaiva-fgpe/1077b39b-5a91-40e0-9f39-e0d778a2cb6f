<h4>Repetitions</h4>
<p> Write a program that checks the text for repeated words (ie occurring more than once, not necessarily next to each other). Ignore case sensitivity. 
<p> There are three different examples of execution flows below: </p> 
<ol>
<p> I eat what I eat = &gt; <code> contains </code> (&#39; eat &#39;) </p>
<p> &#9; A cow is a dog = &gt; <code> does not contain </code> </p>
<p> &#9; Aha aha aha blah blah blah = &gt; <code> contains </code> (&#39; aha &#39; and &#39; bla &#39;) </p> </ol>
<p> Please do not display duplicate words, the program only has to display <code> contains </code> or <code> does not contain </code>. </p>
<br>
<p> If you would like to test how your code works, feel free to use the example above. </p>
<p> To complete the task, write your code and click the Submit button. </p> <br>
<p> Good luck! </p>
