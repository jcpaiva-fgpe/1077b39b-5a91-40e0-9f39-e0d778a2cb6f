<p> Write a program that accepts in a loop some text from the user input with obligatory company e-mail addresses. </p>
<p> The program is supposed to pay attention only to text fragments where an e-mail address appeared, the rest of the text can be ignored. The program is to return the names separated by a period and numbers that appeared in the username of the email address. These numbers are to appear on the screen in descending order. If any of the numbers are repeated, it is to be included only once. Please pay attention to the correctness of the e-mail address. For simplicity, assume that alphanumeric and mandatory characters must appear in the corporate username. and @ (period and at sign). Then the name of the server followed by the TLD abbreviation. </p>
<br> <p> An example of an execution flow: </p>
<ol>
    <p> Computer: <code> E-mail strings: </code> </p>
    <p> User: <code> To the manager address: dom123.budex@gmx.com </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> 1) dom123.budex 3 2 1 </code> </p>
    <p> User: <code> My friends are: 1Xi.1vg21@qq.cn, 10i.g12h1@qq.cn and 13i.c121a@qq.cn </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> 1) 1Xi.1vg21 2 1 </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> 2) 10i.g12h1 2 1 0 </code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code> 3) 13i.c121a 3 2 1 </code> </p>
    <p> User: <code>1@.com</code> </p>
    <p> Computer: <code>False</code> </p>
    <p> Computer terminates the program.</p>
</ol>
<p> Note: If the user enters a sentence (from a new line) without a valid e-mail address, the computer has to display <code> False </code> and terminate the program. </p>
