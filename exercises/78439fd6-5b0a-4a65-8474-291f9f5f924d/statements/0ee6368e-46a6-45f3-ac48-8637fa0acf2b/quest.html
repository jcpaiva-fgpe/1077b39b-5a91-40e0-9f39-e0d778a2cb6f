<h4> Word game </h4>
<br>
<p> Write a program that allows the user to play words. The rules of this game are as follows: </p>
<ol>
    <li> The computer displays the text &#39; Enter a word beginning with A: &#39; (User provides the word). If the User enters a word beginning with a different letter than A, he loses the game (an appropriate message is displayed, see the example of an execution flow below). </li>
    <li> The computer displays the text &#39; Enter a word starting with @: &#39; where the last letter of the previous word should appear instead of the @ sign. (User provides the word.) </li>
    <li> If the User does not enter the correct letter, they lose (an appropriate message 'Game over.' is displayed). </li>
    <li> If the User enters the correct letter, go back to point 2. </li>
        The letters are not case-sensitive (a and A are the same).
<br>
</ol>
