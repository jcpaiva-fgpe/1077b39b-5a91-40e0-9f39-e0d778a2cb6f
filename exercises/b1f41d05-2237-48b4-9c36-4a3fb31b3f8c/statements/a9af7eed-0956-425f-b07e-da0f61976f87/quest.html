<h4> Decimal dominant number </h4>
<br>
<p> Write a program that reads a sequence of natural numbers separated by spaces, and returns the natural number which occurs the most frequent. If the same number occurs many times, just return the first one. </p>
<br>
<p> Examples of operation: </p>
<ol> User: <code> 3 12 3 4 </code> 
<br> Computer: <code> 3 </code>
<br> User: <code> 7 4 1 1 7 1 </code> 
<br> Computer: <code> 1 </code>
<br> User: <code> 2 3 </code> 
<br> Computer: <code> 2 </code>
</ol>
<p> The program does not have to display the number of times the numbers are repeated, it only has to display the natural number which repeats in the sequence at most (dominates). </p> <br>
<p> If you would like to test how your code works, feel free to use the example above. </p>
