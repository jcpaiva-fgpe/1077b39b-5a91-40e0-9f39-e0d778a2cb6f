<h4> 200+ child benefit </h4>
<br>
<p> The 200+ child benefit is analogous to 200 Euro / month. Qualified are families from a second and each subsequent child, regardless of the family income. The child benefit for the first child may be obtained if the income per family member does not exceed per month EUR 500, or EUR 800 per family member, in case if any of the children in the family is handicapped. Write a program that asks the user for the number of children, income per family member, and only if applicable asks if there are any disabled children, and calculates the amount of the child benefit. </p>
