<h4> Stops en route </h4>
<br>
<p> The code lists the names of the stops for the first part of the silk route. Write a program that reads the name first from the user
the pick-up stop, then reads the name of the pick-up stop from the user, and at the end it will display one line
all the stops in between. the part of the route is saved in a variable silk_road = "Beijing - Xian - Lanzhou - Xiahe - Wuwei - Zhangye - Jiayuguan Pass - Dunhuang - Turpan - Urumqi - Kashgar - Shanghai"
<br> Example of an execution flow: </p>
<ol>
    Computer: <code> In? </code> <br>
    User: <code> Xian </code> <br>
    Computer: <code> Out? </code> <br>
    User: <code> Zhangye </code> <br>
    Computer: <code> Route: Lanzhou Xiahe Wuwei </code>
</ol>
<p> Note 1: The pick-up (In) and get-off (Out) stops can be given in any order!
(Both Xian - Zhangye and Zhangye - Xian routes are acceptable.) </p>
<p> Note 2: While user is providing a stop out of the list, the program should not cause a runtime error, only displaying the appropriate message: 'False'. </p>
